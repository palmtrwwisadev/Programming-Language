# Programming Language
A random programming language that i made when i was bored with the c programming language

## Installation
Clone the git repository, open a terminal type: ```make```. 
Then a hello.out file will appear. You can add this to your path so you can just do ```hello``` instead of ```./hello.out``` By typing ```make install```.
There is an examples folder so you can do ```hello examples/main.hello``` or ```./hello.out examples/main.hello```.
But you can write your own files if you want.
